			<h2>Ohana</h2>
			<p>My family is my heart.  I have the cutest golden retriever named Chewy. He definitely knows how to use those puppy dog eyes to get what he wants.  I am about to marry my best friend, Walt.  He is one of the most amazing men I have ever met.  And I also have the best parents and sister anyone could ask for. I am truly blessed.</p>

			<h2>My Quirky Side</h2>
			<p>I am a bit of a gamer.  I love video and computer games; especially Starcraft.  Unfortunately I haven't been able to play the Heart of the Swarm because I have been putting all my free time into studying.  But as soon as I can, I will be back to help terran defeat the zerg and protoss.  SCV ready!</p>

			<p>You probably guessed it from the picture...I really love onesies.  They are so comfortable;  I especially like the ones with holes for your thumbs.  My favorite has to be my disney onesie. Swag swag swag.  </p>
